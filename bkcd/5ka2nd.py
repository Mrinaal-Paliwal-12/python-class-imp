# Write a Python program to list all the factorial numbers less than or equal to an
# input number n. Use recursive function to calculate factorial. (10)
# A number N is called a factorial number if it is the factorial of a positive integer.
# For example, the first few factorial numbers are
# 1,2,6,24,120 â€¦.
# Note : We do not list the factorial of 0.
# Input : A positive integer, say n.
# Output: All factorial numbers less than or equal to n.
